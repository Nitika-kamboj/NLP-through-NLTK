## 04).Part of Speech Tagging with NLTK

One of the more powerful aspects of the NLTK module is the Part of Speech tagging that it can do for you. This means labeling words in a sentence as nouns, adjectives, verbs...etc. 

A new sentence tokenizer, called the PunktSentenceTokenizer. This tokenizer is capable of unsupervised machine learning, so you can actually train it on any body of text that you use.
