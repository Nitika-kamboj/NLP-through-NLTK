## Text classification with NLTK

The goal with text classification can be pretty broad. Maybe we're trying to classify text as about politics or the military. Maybe we're trying to classify it by the gender of the author who wrote it. A fairly popular text classification task is to identify a body of text as either spam or not spam, for things like email filters. In our case, we're going to try to create a sentiment analysis algorithm.
