## Scikit-Learn Sklearn with NLTK

We've seen by now how easy it can be to use classifiers out of the box, and now we want to try some more! The best module for Python to do this with is the Scikit-learn (sklearn) module.

Luckily for us, the people behind NLTK forsaw the value of incorporating the sklearn module into the NLTK classifier methodology. As such, they created the SklearnClassifier API of sorts.
