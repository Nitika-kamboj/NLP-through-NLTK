An introduction to the essential tools in Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

### NLP

Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. It is the branch of machine learning which is about analyzing any text and handling predictive analysis.

Steps that were implemented are:-

*  Getting Data from Twitter Streaming API
   * Step 1: Getting Twitter API keys
   * Step 2: Connecting to Twitter Streaming API and downloading data
   * Step 3: Mining the tweets
   
* Entering the phase or words whose relevant tweets you want to stream
